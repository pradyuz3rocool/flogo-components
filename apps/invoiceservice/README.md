# Invoice Service
This sample Flogo application is used to demonstrate some key Flogo constructs:

- Input/Output mappings
- Complex object mapping
- Invoke REST service

## Building the app
To build via the Flogo CLI, simply download the invoiceservice.json to your local machine and create the app structure:

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
flogo create -f invoiceservice.json invoiceservice
cd invoiceservice
```

Now you can simply build the application and leverage the HTTP REST trigger as the entry point:

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
flogo build -e
```

The -e switch indicates that the binary should embed the flogo.json.

## Run the application

Now that the application has been built, run the application:

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
cd bin
export HTTPPORT=8888
export PAYMENTSERVICE=http://localhost:9999/api/expected-date/:id
./invoiceservice
```

_Note that this app does require the paymentservice app to be running as well_

Test the application by opening your browser or via CURL and getting the following URL: http://localhost:8888/api/invoices/2345

The following result should appear:

```json
{"amount":1456,"balance":456,"currency":"USD","expectedPaymentDate":"2018-02-28","id":"2345","ref":"INV-2345"}
```

_Note that the expectedPaymentDate comes from the paymentservice app. If that app isn't running or if the URL is misconfigured it will return as null_

## Importing into Flogo Web
If you want to import this flow into Flogo Web, please note there is a this is a current limitation in Flogo Web that it doesn't automatically import activities you do not have installed yet. To workaround this you can open an existing flow (or create a new flow) and import the activities using the "Install new activity" button. For this app you'll need to install:

* Random Number: https://github.com/retgits/flogo-components/activity/randomnumber
* Random String: https://github.com/retgits/flogo-components/activity/randomstring
* Combine: https://github.com/jvanderl/flogo-components/activity/combine
